            <img src="Assets\images\project 1.PNG" alt="Project 1"></a>
            <p>This was the first project that worked on while in the Bootcamp. It was cheat sheet for the prework-study guide. I have been fallen back to this quite frequetnly throught my time in the Bootcamp and it has helped me out various times.</p>

            <img src="Assets\images\project 2.PNG" alt="Project 2">
            <p>Though this may not seem like a lot this is a personal project of my mine that I started a few weeks before the bootcamp started. It is a game called Chi-Po that me and my friends love to play but since most of us are away for most of the year my plan was to make a way for us to play online. My idea is by the end of this bootcamp I will be skilled enough to make a webpage where we can play it online with eachother.</p>
